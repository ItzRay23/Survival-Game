## Details

This project was made from learning Software Development Foundations in CPSC-2150. This is meant to showcase use of some of the skills learned during the study of these foundations. This is a simple game with features being added as I have time to develop it. Do not expect to find a good game or anything special, just a little side project of mine to showcase my software development skills.
